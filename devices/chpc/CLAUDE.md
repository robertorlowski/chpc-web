# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project

CHPC (Cheap Heat Pump Controller) is an Arduino firmware for an AVR board that runs a heat pump. It switches the compressor, the hot-side and cold-side circulating pumps, the sump (compressor) heater and a 4-way valve. It drives a stepper EEV, reads DS18B20 temperature sensors on OneWire, measures compressor power with a current transformer, and is controlled from a 1602 I2C LCD with buttons and/or RS-485. This is a fork of github.com/gonzho000/chpc (GPLv3). The fork adds changes on this branch, such as COP calculation, RS-485 commands and wattage limits stored in EEPROM. Commit messages and some code comments are in Polish.

The entire firmware is one file: [src/CHPC_firmware.ino](src/CHPC_firmware.ino), about 2200 lines. [archiwum/](archiwum/) holds old snapshots of the firmware and is not built. Do not read, search or use it as a reference (access is denied in `.claude/settings.json`). [docs/](docs/) holds the PCB files (Gerber, BOM, schematic) and photos.

## Building / flashing

The project builds with PlatformIO ([platformio.ini](platformio.ini), env `promini` = Arduino Pro Mini ATmega328P 5V/16MHz). There is no linter or test suite. The libraries (`OneWire`, `DallasTemperature`, `LiquidCrystal_I2C`) come from `lib_deps`.

```sh
pio run                            # compile (pio is in ~/.platformio/penv/Scripts/ if not on PATH)
pio run -t upload --upload-port COM3
pio device monitor                 # 9600 baud
```

The "redefined" warnings for `DISPLAY`, `INPUTS`, `BUTTON_REPEAT_MS` and similar come from PlatformIO's ino-to-cpp pass, which ignores `#ifdef`. They are harmless. The real compile warnings come after them.

**Flash is ~92% full** (about 2.3 KB of 30 KB free). Check the `Flash:` line after every change. `String` concatenation is expensive here, so prefer `F("...")` and direct `print` calls.

**Tests on the PC (main test path).** Use these first, because they are fast and have no quota.

- **Unity firmware simulation.** `pio test -e native` runs 6 scenario suites in `test/test_chpc_*`, about 12 s in total. Each suite compiles the unmodified `src/CHPC_firmware.ino` against hardware mocks in [test/sim_env/](test/sim_env/):
  - `Arduino.h`: virtual `millis`/`delay`, a `String` class, the UART, and a CT sine wave for the power reading;
  - `DallasTemperature.h`: sensors that can be plugged in and out;
  - `EEPROM.h` and `LiquidCrystal_I2C.h`.

  `chpc_sim.h` provides the helpers: `boot()`, which runs sensor discovery like a human would, plus `runMs()`, `waitUntil()`, `query()`/`sendFrame()` (acting as `co`), `jsonNumber()` and `resetGlobalsLikeReboot()`.
- **Harness rules.**
  - Each suite runs as its own process. Tests inside a suite form one ordered scenario, because firmware globals are never reset between them.
  - A reboot is `resetGlobalsLikeReboot()` + `setup()`. It also restarts `millis()` from zero.
  - Long waits use `runMs(ms, 1000..2000)`. Right after a stop, sample densely (`runMs(3000)`), otherwise the RMS power window still carries the old power.
  - Firmware functions that are called before they are defined need a prototype in `chpc_sim.h`. Arduino IDE and PlatformIO add these prototypes automatically; this build does not.
- **Full chain across all three projects.** `test/e2e/` joins the pieces:
  - `bridge.exe`, built by `build-bridge.sh`, combines the simulated firmware with the real `co` code (`operation_parser`, `operation_controller`, `modbus_frame`, `cop_estimator`);
  - `run-e2e.mjs` plays `co`'s HTTP role against a local `chpc-web` and drives the web UI with Playwright and the system Edge.

  To run it:
  1. start `npm run local` in chpc-web: a persistent MongoDB in `.local-db/` plus the server on 4001 and the client on 5173;
  2. `cd test/e2e && npm install && sh build-bridge.sh && node run-e2e.mjs`.

  Results go to `docs/raport-testow/` (`e2e-wyniki.json`, `e2e-log.txt`, screenshots). The folder is created by the run and ignored by git, so it exists only locally.

**Simulation (Wokwi, secondary).** [test-wokwi/](test-wokwi/) (described in its README.md) holds a Wokwi project: `diagram.json` (a Nano stands in for the Pro Mini), `wokwi.toml` (points to the PlatformIO build) and `scenario.yaml`. The scenario runs the whole flow. It discovers the sensors (each DS18B20 is attached through a push button to mimic plugging it in), sends RS-485 frames, resets the board and checks that EEPROM survived. The CI token is in `.wokwi-token` in the repo root, which git ignores. `wokwi-cli` is not installed globally; download `wokwi-cli-win-x64.exe` from the wokwi-cli GitHub releases.

```sh
pio run && WOKWI_CLI_TOKEN=$(grep -m1 -o 'wok_[A-Za-z0-9]*' .wokwi-token) wokwi-cli test-wokwi --scenario scenario.yaml --timeout 280000
```

The free plan stops a run after 5 minutes, and sensor discovery alone takes about 60 s of simulated time. Wokwi does not simulate resistor dividers, so A6 (the current sensor) is biased by a potentiometer at mid position. Keep the setpoint below `Ttarget` in scenarios, because the simulated current reading is not realistic once the compressor starts. A sensor's temperature can be changed during a run with `set-control: { part-id: sTbe, control: temperature, value: -1 }`. This works although the Wokwi docs do not list it. Messages printed with `Print_D` go only to the LCD, so scenarios cannot wait for them. A logic analyzer (`la`) records RX (D0) and TX (D1). Run with `--vcd-file out.vcd`, then `test-wokwi/latency.sh out.vcd` prints, for each RS-485 request, the simulated time until the reply starts ("brak" means no reply). Wall-clock time is useless for this, because Wokwi does not run at a steady speed. The free plan also has a monthly CI-minute quota, which ran out on 2026-09-23.

RS-485 runs at 9600 baud on the hardware UART (pins 0/1); `RS485Serial` is a `#define` for `Serial`. That means RS-485 is disconnected while the board is being flashed over USB.


## Configuration model (compile-time `#define`s)

Behaviour is selected by editing the `USER OPTIONS` block at the top of the `.ino`, lines ~21–119. Nothing is selected at runtime:

- **Board:** only `BOARD_TYPE_G` (the gonzho000 PCB v1.3) is supported. Support for boards F and G9 (relays driven through a 74HC595) was removed. `halifise()` writes the relay outputs.
- **Display:** `DISPLAY_1602` (I2C LCD 16x2, address 0x27) or `DISPLAY_NONE`. The 0.96" OLED support (`DISPLAY_096`) was removed.
- **Serial mode:** `RS485_HUMAN`, `RS485_PYTHON` or `RS485_NONE`.
- **Feature flags:** `EEV_SUPPORT`, `EEV_ONLY`, `INPUTS_AS_BUTTONS` and `EEV_DEBUG`. `WATCHDOG` was removed: on a Pro Mini with the stock bootloader, a watchdog reset can end in an endless reset loop. Restart is done in software instead (`softRestart()`, a jump to address 0).
- **Protection thresholds:** `T_*_MIN/MAX`, `MAX_WATTS`. **Timing constants:** `POWERON_PAUSE`, `MINCYCLE_*`, `DEFFERED_STOP_*`. **EEV tuning:** `EEV_*`. Note: several `T_*` defines end with a stray `;`, so they can only be used as whole initializers (`const double cT_x = T_X;`), not inside expressions.

The power limit `c_wattage_max` also works as a deliberate switch. When it is above `MAX_WATTS` (3200), the flow protection ("Err CP") is on. The user sets exactly 3200 W to turn it off, for example when the heat pump runs from another power source on which the flow sensor is unreliable. Keep this coupling.

Code is heavily wrapped in `#ifdef`. When you change logic, make sure it still compiles under the other display, serial and EEV combinations, or guard it correctly.

## Runtime architecture

The sketch uses the usual `setup()`/`loop()` structure. All state is in globals, including shared scratch variables `i, z, x, y, d, e, tempint, tempdouble, outString`. Check that a scratch variable isn't already in use before you reuse it.

- **`setup()`:** sets up the pins, then initializes serial and display (`InitS_and_D`). It loads persisted settings from EEPROM and discovers the DS18B20 addresses (`FindAddr`), which it stores in EEPROM behind the `MAGIC` byte. Changing `MAGIC` forces the sensors to be discovered again.
- **`loop()`:** is non-blocking and timed with `millis()`. Each pass:
  1. Takes one current sample for the asynchronous RMS power measurement (`async_wattage`). Supply voltage comes from `ReadVcc()`.
  2. Advances the EEV stepper by at most one step (`eevise()`), following `EEV_apulses`, `EEV_fast` and the `EEV_PULSE_*_MILLIS` pacing.
  3. Checks for overload and reads the emergency input.
  4. Parses RS-485 commands. This block sits before the check cycle so that it still runs while the check cycle `return`s during `POWERON_PAUSE`. Code placed after the check cycle can be skipped by that `return`. Right after it, `error_count >= 5` (lock) ends the pass: control stops, but RS-485 keeps answering and accepts `0x10` (unlock) and `0x11` (restart).
  5. Handles buttons (`input_type` selects which setting the buttons edit: `INPUT_TYPE_*`), then updates the display.
  6. Runs the **check cycle** once every `millis_cycle` (1 s). It reads the temperatures (`Get_Temperatures`; `-127` means the sensor is missing). It sets `errorcode` (`ERR_*`), runs the EEV control algorithm (keep superheat Tae−Tbe at `T_EEV_setpoint`), and then decides whether the compressor, pumps and sump heater should run. That decision applies the protections and the minimum on/off cycle times. `stopOnError()` is the common shutdown path. While the compressor is off, frost protection (`frost_protect`) runs the hot-side pump when any connected sensor is ≤ `T_FROST_ON` (0 °C). It stops the pump once all sensors are ≥ `T_FROST_OFF` (2 °C).
- **Sensors:** the DS18B20s live in `st_tsens sensors[T_SENSORS]`, indexed by `BIT_*`, which is also their bit in `used_sensors` and their slot in the EEPROM address layout. `Tae, Tbe, Ttarget, Tsump, Tci, Tco, Thi, Tho, Tbc, Tac, Touter, Tcwu` are references to the array elements, and `sensor_names[]` holds their display names. Code that handles every sensor the same way loops over the array. `.e` marks a sensor as enabled. The README table explains the abbreviations.
- **EEPROM:** runtime-tunable settings sit at fixed addresses (`eeprom_addr_co`, `_EEV_MAX`, `_EEV_MIN`, `_EEV_setpoint`, `_dT`, `_WATT`) and are written with `WriteFloatEEPROM`/`WriteIntEEPROM`. The sensor addresses are stored before these, so keep new addresses clear of both.
- **RS-485 commands:** handled in the `switch` in the RS-485 block of `loop()` (step 4 above). The response is built by `StatsSerial()`. New settings must be written to EEPROM when they need to survive a reboot. The protocol is a contract with another project, described in the next section.

## RS-485 contract with the `co` controller

The bus master is a separate ESP32 project, `D:\DevLocal\arduino_src\heatpump\co` (PlatformIO, its own git repo). It polls this heat pump, forwards the data to a cloud service, computes COP and sends settings back. **Any change to the frame format, command codes, value encoding or JSON keys must be made in both projects.** On the `co` side, the relevant code is:

- `src/modbus_frame.cpp`: command encoding, covered by `test/test_modbus_frame` (`pio test -e native`).
- `src/serial_bus.cpp`: queue, timing and frame detection.
- `src/heat_pump_data_processor.cpp` and `src/cop_estimator.cpp`: JSON parsing and COP.
- `src/device_io.cpp`: the TFT dashboard.
- `src/operation_controller.cpp`: which commands are sent and when.

**Bus.** Half-duplex RS-485, 9600 8N1. The same line carries three devices, and only `co` starts a transfer:

| Address | Device | Frame format |
|---|---|---|
| `0x41` | this heat pump | 5-byte frames described below |
| `0x69` | Hoymiles DTU (PV inverters) | Modbus RTU with CRC; responses are about 200 bytes |
| `0x10` | `co` itself | answers 4-byte requests `[0x10][op][x][0xFF]` |

CHPC must ignore every frame whose first byte isn't `0x41` and must never send anything it wasn't asked for.

**Request.** `[0x41][cmd][d1][d2][0xFF]`. Decimal values are sent as `d1` = whole part and `d2` = hundredths, so 45.5 is sent as `[45][50]`. Watts are sent as `d1` = W/100 and `d2` = W%100.

| cmd | Meaning | Sent by `co` |
|---|---|---|
| `0x01` | return JSON stats | GET_HP_DATA: every 10 s while running, every 30 s idle (every 10th poll goes to the PV inverters instead) |
| `0x02` | same as `0x01` | not used |
| `0x03` | force start, `d1` = 0/1 | SET_HP_FORCE_ON/OFF |
| `0x04` | T setpoint (CO max), decimal | SET_T_SETPOINT_CO = `co_max` or `cwu_max` |
| `0x05` | T delta, decimal | SET_T_DELTA_CO = max − min |
| `0x07` | EEV max open | not used (duplicate of `0x0D`) |
| `0x08` | EEV superheat setpoint, decimal | SET_EEV_SETPOINT |
| `0x09` / `0x0A` / `0x0B` | force hot pump / cold pump / sump heater, `d1` = 0/1 | SET_HOT_PUMP / SET_COLD_PUMP / SET_SUMP_HEATER |
| `0x0C` | CO on/off, `d1` = 0/1 | SET_HP_CO_ON/OFF |
| `0x0D` | EEV max open pulses, `d1` 26–255 (≤ 25 ignored). If the new maximum is ≤ the minimum, the minimum drops to max − 1. `0x07` behaves the same | SET_EEV_MAXPULSES_OPEN (`co` accepts `eev_max_pulse_open` 0–255) |
| `0x0F` | EEV min work position, `d1` 25–255 (< 25 ignored). If the new minimum is ≥ the maximum, the maximum rises to min + 1. It is stored in EEPROM, the same as the buttons use. `co` sends `0x0D` before `0x0F`, so any valid pair ends up as requested | SET_EEV_MINWORKPOS (`co` accepts `eev_min_pulse_open` 0–255, set in the web UI Settings tab) |
| `0x0E` | max watts, `d1*100 + d2`. Only 1001 to `MAX_WATTS_LIMIT` (4000) is accepted; anything else is ignored | SET_WORKING_WATT (`co` accepts `working_watt` 0–25599 from the cloud) |
| `0x10` | unlock: resets `error_count` (clears the `Error x5` lock); pumps keep running | HP_ERROR_RESET from the one-shot operation `error_reset:"1"` |
| `0x11` | software restart (`softRestart()`): relays off, `setup()` again, EEPROM reload, EEV calibration, 90 s pause | HP_RESTART from the one-shot operation `restart:"1"`. `co` then resends its whole state with the next operation, because CHPC forgets forced pumps and force start |

**Response to `0x01`.** One JSON object on one line, sent by `StatsSerial()`. `co` detects the end of the frame by 5 ms of silence and times out after 3 s. It spaces commands at least 500 ms apart and never waits for a reply to set-commands. This puts three constraints on CHPC:

- It must answer within 3 s, and the loop must not block for long. While it blocks, frames from `co` pile up in the UART buffer. The parser handles consecutive `[0x41 … 0xFF]` frames in one read, but a frame behind other bus traffic (a PV response) is still lost. `LiquidCrystal_I2C::begin()` alone contains `delay(1000)`, so outside `setup()` it is called only once a minute. Other blocking `delay()`s, slow `GetT` retries and the `error_count >= 5` lock-up still risk timeouts, which `co` counts in its `serial_read_timeout` telemetry.
- The JSON must go out without pauses longer than 5 ms.
- Nothing else may be sent while `co` waits for the response. JSON that fails to parse is counted in `hp_json_error`.

JSON keys `co` depends on (don't rename or remove them; adding keys is fine within the flash budget). Values may be numbers or quoted strings, because `co` accepts both:

- **COP calculation:** `HPS` (>0 = compressor running), `Tho`, `Ttarget`. Also `lt_pow`: Wh used since the last compressor start, reset at every start. And `lt_hp_on`: seconds of the current run, or the length of the last run once the compressor has stopped.
- **Dashboard:** `F`, `CO`, `Ttarget`, `Tmin`, `Tmax`, `Tbe`, `Tae`, `Tsump`, `Tho`, `EEV`, `EEV_dt`, `EEV_pos`, `Watts`, `HCS`, `CCS`.
- **Web app (chpc-web):** `EEVmax` and `EEVmin`, the current EEV limits. They also fill in the defaults of the Settings form.
- **Errors:**
  - `ERR`: code of the last error event;
  - `ERRn`: event sequence number, which grows with every event, so a repeated code is still a new event;
  - `ERRc`: `error_count`; 5 means locked.

  The codes are `ERRC_*` in the firmware and `client/src/utils/errors.ts` in chpc-web; change both together. 1 sensor, 2 overload, 3 no flow, 4 wattage min, 5 Tho, 6 Tsump high, 7 Tbc, 8 Tae, 9 Tco, 10 relay, 11 locked x5, 12 Tsump low. Each event also shows `ERR: …` on the LCD.
- **Cloud:** the whole object is forwarded as telemetry `HP`.

**Known mismatches with the current firmware:**

- `0x04` above `T_SETPOINT_MAX` and `0x05` above `T_DELTA_MAX` are silently ignored.
- With `RS485_HUMAN`, `PrintS_and_D()` also writes status and error text to the bus without being asked (for example "Err: x" every second while `errorcode != 0`). That breaks the rule against sending unrequested data and can corrupt HP or PV reads.

## Cloud path: `co` ⇄ `chpc-web`

The data from this firmware continues to a web app, `D:\DevLocal\arduino_src\chpc-web` (its own git repo). It has an Express + TypeScript + Mongoose server in `server/src`, a React + Vite client in `client/src`, and a system description in `SYSTEM-LOGIC.md`. It is deployed at `https://chpc-web.onrender.com`. The whole chain is **chpc ⇄ RS-485 ⇄ co ⇄ HTTPS/WebSocket ⇄ chpc-web**. A change to any field has to be followed through all three repos. On the `co` side, the relevant files are `src/cloud_client.cpp`, `telemetry.cpp`, `operation_parser.cpp` and `operation_controller.cpp`.

**Telemetry.** `co` sends `POST /api/hp/add?rootId=<id>` every 10 s while the compressor runs and every 30 s when idle. The body contains:
- `HP`: the JSON from `StatsSerial()`, forwarded unchanged;
- `PV`: the inverter data;
- `time` as `"YYYY.MM.DD HH:MM:SS"`;
- `work_mode`, `co_min`, `co_max`, `cwu_min`, `cwu_max`, `co_pomp`, `cwu_pomp`, `pv_power`, `controller_mode`;
- COP estimates (`cop`, `cop_min`, `cop_max`, `t_min`, `t_max`, `cop_bottom_start`), computed by `co` from `HPS`, `Tho`, `Ttarget`, `lt_pow` and `lt_hp_on`;
- diagnostic counters (`serial_read_timeout`, `hp_json_error`, `pv_crc_error`, `cloud_*`, `operation_validation_error`…).

The server saves a record only when `HP.Ttarget` is truthy. It adds `t_out` (outdoor temperature from a weather API) and pushes a WebSocket `"update"` to browsers.

**Errors.** When `HP.ERRn` differs from the previous record and `HP.ERR` is not 0, the server stores the code in the top-level `error_code` field of the new record (`detectErrorEvent` in `server/src/services/hp.service.ts`). `GET /api/hp/last-error` returns the newest record with `error_code` from the last 24 hours (a rolling window, not calendar days); older errors stay only in the data list. The client shows a small red bell in front of the "T:" label on the main view (error within 24 h or lock; description and time in the tooltip), a red row under the record in the data list, and the error, the counter and the "Odblokuj" and "Restart sterownika" buttons on the Settings tab.

**The Mongo schema is strict** (`server/src/models/model.ts`), so any key it does not list is silently dropped. That includes `EEV_pulse`, `cop_min`, `cop_max`, `controller_mode` and **all diagnostic counters**. The latest raw body stays available through `GET /api/hp`, which serves an in-memory cache, until the server restarts. **A new telemetry key must be added to the schema, the TS types `server/src/middleware/type.ts` and `client/src/api/type.ts`, and the client views**, or it will not be stored or shown.

**Operation.** The response to every POST is `{"operation":{…}}`. **All values are strings**, e.g. `"1"`, `"45"`. The keys are:
- `work_mode`: `M`, `A`, `CWU`, `OFF`. `co` also accepts `PV`, which the server never sends.
- `force`, `co_pomp`, `hot_pomp`, `cold_pomp`, `sump_heater`: `"0"` or `"1"`.
- `co_min`, `co_max`, `cwu_min`, `cwu_max`;
- `working_watt`, `eev_max_pulse_open`, `eev_min_pulse_open`, `eev_setpoint`.
- **One-shot actions** `error_reset` and `restart` (value `"1"`). They are queued by `POST /api/operation/action {action}`, added to exactly one `/hp/add` response and never merged into the manual or scheduled operation. `co` turns them into `0x10` / `0x11` and does not keep them.

Where the values come from:
- **Scheduler** (every 60 s): `work_mode`, `force` and the temperatures, from device defaults or the active schedule.
- **Manual overrides** from the `/settings` page (`POST /api/operation/set`): any key. They win over the scheduler, are re-sent on every POST, live only in server memory, and are cleared when an active schedule ends.

`co` parses the operation and turns changed values into RS-485 commands:
- `co_max` / `cwu_max` → `0x04`;
- max − min → `0x05`;
- `working_watt` → `0x0E`;
- `eev_max_pulse_open` → `0x0D`, then `eev_min_pulse_open` → `0x0F`, then `eev_setpoint` → `0x08`;
- pumps and force → `0x09`–`0x0B`, `0x03`;
- work mode → `0x0C` plus `co`'s own CO/CWU relays.

`co` sends each value only once, and does not resend it until it changes.

**Validation happens in three places, each silently:**
- `chpc-web` checks nothing: neither the UI nor `/operation/set` has range checks.
- `co` rounds `co_*`/`cwu_*` to whole degrees in 1–50, and accepts `working_watt` 0–25599, `eev_max_pulse_open` 0–255 and `eev_setpoint` 0–255.99.
- CHPC applies its own limits (see the RS-485 table).

A value rejected downstream still shows as "set" in the web UI. Compare it with the telemetry (`WWatt`, `EEVmax`, `Tmax`) to see what the pump really uses.

**Known mismatches** (as of 2026-09-24):
- The server sends the WebSocket message `{type:"operation"}` only for one-shot actions (`/api/operation/action`), so they reach the pump within seconds. Ordinary settings from `/operation/set` still wait for the next periodic POST, 10–30 s later.
- (fixed 2026-09-24) The main view showed `lt_pow` with a "W" unit; it is now labelled "Energia cyklu" in Wh.
- The client's energy-cost code (`client/src/utils/energy-cost-g12w.ts`) expects `YYYY-MM-DD` timestamps, while `co` sends `YYYY.MM.DD`.
- The time of an error is the time of the telemetry record that first carries the new `ERRn` (see **Errors** above), so it is accurate to 10–30 s. CHPC has no clock.
- The server's API-key check (`verifyApiKey`) is disabled in `server/src/middleware/app.ts`. `POST /api/operation/set` is open and unvalidated.
- `chpc-web` tests (`npm test -w server`, vitest + mongodb-memory-server) cover the scheduler, `EEVmin` storage, error-event detection and one-shot actions. They do not cover the WebSocket.
